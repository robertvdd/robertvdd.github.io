<h1>About Me</h1>

I am an atmospheric scientist interested in both weather and climate. A major intersection between these two is the study of extreme weather events, which require both a physical understanding underpining meteorological storm systems and a more theoretical and statistical perspective from climate science. 

My PhD work is on precipitation extremes produced by thunderstorms and other types of buoyancy-driven storms (broadly referred to as "convection"). Convection is responsible for some of the heaviest rainfall in the tropics and mid-latitudes. Specifically, I have explored the surprising and complex ways that environmental relative humidity modifies the intensity and precipitation efficiency of convection. Check out the <a href="{{ "/research" | absolute_url }}">Research</a> page for more details. 

<!-- I have identified that relative humidity significantly alters convection (beyond just the fact that drier air has less moisture to rain out). By accounting for this unexpected role of relative humidity, we can better understand spatial and seasonal patterns of rainfall extremes both present-day Earth and in climate change projections. -->

I grew up in central North Carolina, where I gained notoriety from my elementary school peers for being obsessed with the weather. Instead of going outside for recess, I convinced my teachers to let me watch episodes of <i>Storm Chasers</i>. Later, I graduated from North Carolina State University with a B.S. in Meteorology, a B.S. in Applied Mathematics, and a minor in Physics. Read more about my professional background on my CV.
