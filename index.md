<h1>About Me</h1>

I am an atmospheric scientist interested in both weather and climate. A major intersection between meteorlogy and climate science is the study of extreme weather events, which require both a physical understanding underpining meteorological storm systems and a more theoretical and statistical view from climate science. 

My PhD work is on precipitation extremes produced by thunderstorms and other types of buoyancy-driven storms (broadly referred to as "convection"). Convection is responsible for some of the heaviest rainfall in the tropics and mid-latitudes. My PhD focuses on what environmental factors physically control the amount of rain produced by strong convection. I have identified that relative humidity significantly alters convection (beyond just the fact that drier air has less moisture to rain out). By accounting for this unexpected role of relative humidity, we can better understand spatial and seasonal patterns of rainfall extremes both present-day Earth and in climate change projections.

I graduated from North Carolina State University with a B.S. in Meteorology, a B.S. in Applied Mathematics, and a minor in Physics. Read more on my CV.
