<p>I am a 3rd year graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working with <a href="https://pog.mit.edu">Paul O'Gorman</a>. I am interested in the atmospheric and climate dynamics, particularly those of extreme events. My approach is mechanistic: I view an "extreme event" not as a statistic but as belonging to a class of <i>phenomena</i>. For example, extreme preciptation may be produced by a number of different types of storms: disorganized convection, organized convection, tropical cyclones, extratropical systems. By understanding idealized versions of each of these phenomena through mathematical theory and idealized computer simulation, a holistic portfolio can be constructed that explains a given region's heavy precipitation. 

I completed my undergraduate degree at North Carolina State University, where I double-majored in Meteorology and Applied Mathematics.
