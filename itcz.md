title: ITCZ Breakdown

---


<!---
1. Paragraph introducing ITCZ
    a. Broad overview
    b. Big thing I want to emphasize here: how, exactly, is the ITCZ defined? It can be viewed from a variety of lenses and timescales.
    c. Can maybe include a schematic from a theoretical paper or textbook, w/ *proper credit* of course. 

2. Paragraph introducing ITCZ Breakdown
    a. Past studies, barotropic instability theory

3. Summarizing of lack of understanding and purpose of research:
    a. Can ITCZ (breakdown) be reliably identified in Reanalysis datasets (e.g. ERA-Interim)?
    b. Does breakdown rate match theory? "Matching theory" can be broken down into a number of different techniques, but the most important ones are:
        i) Unstable growth rate of some modes
        ii) 

4. Eye-catching animation/graphic:
    I'm thinking the animation of the ITCZ-isolated strip over a few months would be ideal.

The Intertropical Convergence Zone is an important feature of the tropical atmosphere. When averaged over longitude and months or years of time, a clear band of upward-moving air, part of the broader atmospheric circulation, becomes apparent. However, when looking over shorter timescales, the ITCZ signal becomes more complex. Often, the ITCZ can be picked out as a belt of deep convection on satellite imagery.  However, the latitudinal position and zonal structure of this belt can vary on both day-to-day and seasonal scales. As a result, objectively isolating the ITCZ to study its behavior is not always an easy task. But it can be done:

How valuable is this automated tool? One application is to study the phenomenon of "ITCZ Breakdown." Breakdown occurs when a region of the belt of storms undulates, then breaks down into individual storm clusters (which can sometimes go on to form tropical cyclones). Plenty of studies have tried modeling breakdown phenomenon, but little has been done to identify and characterize real-world occurrances of these breakdown events. Do observations of ITCZ breakdown match what models show, and what theory predicts? And if not, why not?
